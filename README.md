</div>

## Overview
 <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <span> Great Smoky Hike Plan is a CRUD application that helps the user filter trail data(for 70+ trails) in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and returns relevant information about the chosen trail from an internal database, and through asynchronous calls to the National Parks API and Cornell Labâ€™s eBird API</span>
</div>


### Users can:
* Filter through data to choose a trail
* Create a Hike Plan based on the trail you choose
* See updates for travel advisories for the park on the homepage
* View all plans created by you (an individual user)
* Edit any plans you create
* Delete any plan you create

2. Create a directory that will hold both github repos. For example, ~/workspace/GreatSmokyHikePlan.
3. In your terminal, cd to that directory.
4. Clone the repo into this folder.

## Setting up the Client

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
